For these courses, you will use real developer tools and software including VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux / Unix command line to complete interactive tutorials and build projects.

These courses start off with basic Bash commands. Using the terminal, you will learn everything from navigating and manipulating a file system, scripting in Bash, all the way to advanced usage.

Next, you will learn how to create and use a relational database with PostgreSQL, a database management system, and SQL, the language of these databases.

Finally, you will learn Git, the version control system, an essential tool of every developer.

### [Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate](./learn-relational-databases/README.md)

The terminal allows you to send text commands to your computer that can manipulate the file system, run programs, automate tasks, and much more.

In this 170-lesson course, you will learn terminal commands by creating a website boilerplate using only the command line.

### [Learn Relational Databases by Building a Mario Database](./how-neural-networks-work/README.md)

A relational database organizes data into tables that are linked together through relationships.

In this 165-lesson course, you will learn the basics of a relational database by creating a PostgreSQL database filled with video game characters.

### [Celestial Bodies Database](./machine-learning-with-python-projects/README.md)

This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.

For this project, you will build a database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL.
